# Migrating from v1 to v2

## getTripPatterns returns an object with metadata

In v1 `getTripPatterns` returned a list of TripPatterns. Now it returns an object with both `tripPatterns` and `metadata`.

```diff
-const tripPatterns = await getTripPatterns(myParams)
+const { tripPatterns, metadata } = await getTripPatterns(myParams)
```
